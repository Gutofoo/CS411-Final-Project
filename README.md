# CS411-Final-Project

things still needed to be fixed before the April 7th deadline:
1. Fix the way login page and register page look (maybe make them modals instead of pages)
2. Need to have reviews populate in the profile page: make sure to use views (advanced technique)
3. Figure out what we are doing for the 2nd advanced feature: google maps visualization
4. Fix the look of edit/delete part when searching

Identified advanced techniques:
1. Indexing
2. Views (for the profile page) -> need to do
3. Constraints

Still need another 3 techniques

Other things to be done:
1. Make the recommendation engine
2. Get the map visualization
3. Pick and add another 3 advanced techniques
