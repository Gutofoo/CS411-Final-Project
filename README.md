# CS411-Final-Project
Things to work on:
1. Recommendation engine (currently Pri is working on this)
2. Google maps Data Visualization (someone can start on this, we'll talk more on Wednesday)
3. Fixing the login/signup pages (someone can do this)
4. Adding the advanced techniques
    a. Indexing (pri needs to add stuff here mainly on the wines table)
    b. Stored procedure (pri already created one for reviews, need to use in rec_eng.php)
    c. constraints (check null constraints for users table, reviews, etc. should already be done)
    
    Need to think of another 3 to use and where (left to choose from):
    I.    parallel query execution
    II.   transaction
    III.  app. query processing
    IV.   triggers
    V.    partioning/sharding
    VI.   prepared statements
    VII.  compound statements
    VIII. views
5. Making reviews page (edit/delete look nicer -> last step)
